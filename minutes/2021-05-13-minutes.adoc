== Proof-of-Concept Status Update

Our development partners at ICT/CAS gave us an update on their status building
proofs of concept for the various new features we have been developing in the
virtual memory TG.

The full set of slides is available here:
https://github.com/riscv/virtual-memory/blob/main/presentations/2021-05-13-PoC-Status.pdf

A brief summary of the discussion is included below.

=== Sv57

* Implemented in NutShell and NEMU
** https://github.com/OSCPU/NutShell
** https://github.com/Ziyue-Zhang/nemu-rv64
* Verified with some basic hand-written tests
* In-progress Linux port extends patches previously posted on Linux kernel
  mailing list

=== Svnapot

* Also developed within NutShell and NEMU
** https://github.com/happy-lx/NutShell
** https://github.com/happy-lx/nemu
* Verified with some simple test cases, including CoreMark and Dhrystone, with
  some perf improvement observed
* TLB notes:
** Fully-associative TLBs can handle the extra NAPOT size(s) easily
** For set-associative TLBs, lookups must check one (or more) extra hash(es),
   one for each new page size (currently just 64KiB)
** For separate per-page-size TLBs, NAPOT requires a new SRAM == more area
* In-progress Linux implementation
** support via MAP_HUGE_64KB flag passed to mmap call for anonymous pages
** No transparent 64KiB page support yet
** fork and copy-on-write in progress, swap and file-backed pages to come

=== Other new features

(Note: references to "Zsa" in this document refer to this section.)

* "LR/SC"-style A/D bit update implemented in Rocket, now debugging
* Also explored HW-maintained coherency between TLBs and memory after A/D bit
  updates performed by HW page table walker
** Not required by spec
